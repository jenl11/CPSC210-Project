# My Personal Project: King's Row


## Details of the Project

For my personal project I built a one player card game.

**Rules:** This game will have the player get rid of all the
cards in their hand by disposing 2 or more cards in alternating colour and consecutive order. If the player isn't able
to dispose any cards that round, then the player will be dealt 3 cards to their hand. The player's goal is to
get rid all the cards in their hand or finish the rows of each colour of Kings (hence the name *King's Row*) in the 
least amount of rounds as possible. 

With this in mind, this project will include two classes for the model, a class defining a card, and a class for the 
deck that can contain the cards. There will also be test classes for both. For the ui, there is the main class and a 
class for the actual game. This Game class will be in charge of all the user inputs and the display of the game on the 
console. The game will also be telling the player if they made any mistakes in the user input or if they didn't meet the 
game requirements and allow the user to try again.  

This game could be used for those who want to play a simple card game but has no one to play with, especially when you 
get bored during these times of isolation. This idea interested me because I am a big fan of card games, especially 
this game called *King's Corner*. Therefore, I thought it would be fun to design a similar game for this project, but a 
little more simple to play since this is only for one player.
