# My Personal Project: King's Row

## Details of the Project

For my personal project I will be building a one player card game.

**Rules:** This game will have the player get rid of all the
cards in their hand by disposing 2 or more cards in alternating colour and consecutive order. If the player isn't able
to dispose any cards that round, then the player will be dealt 3 cards to their hand. The player's goal is to
get rid all the cards in their hand or finish the rows of each colour of Kings (hence the name *King's Row*) in the 
least amount of round as possible. 

With this in mind, this project will include two classes for the model, a class defining a card, and a deck that can 
contain the cards with test classes for both. For the ui, we have the main class and a class for the actual 
game. This Game class will be in charge of all the user inputs and the display of the game on the console. The game will 
also be telling the player if they made any mistakes in the user input or if they didn't meet the game requirements and 
allow the user to try again.  

This game could be used for those who want to play a simple card game but has no one to play with, especially when you 
get bored during these times of quarantining. This idea interested me because I am a big fan of card games, especially 
this game called *King's Corner*. Therefore, I thought it would be fun to design a similar game for this project, but a 
little more simple to play since this is only for one player.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to add cards that I have in my hand to one of the decks if I meet the requirement of 
alternating colour and consecutive rank
- As a user, I want to have a choice to play or quit the game
- As a user, I want to be able to choose which deck I want to put my cards into
- As a user, I want to be able to tell the game I do or don't have cards to play that round
